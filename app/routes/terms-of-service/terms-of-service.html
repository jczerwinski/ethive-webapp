	Although these terms are short, they are also biased. As a startup, we try to minimize low value activities like writing terms of service. We also try to minimize our risk. Unfortunately, this implies a defensive terms of service.
	<br /><br />
	With that said, <a ui-sref="about-us">our mission is to help people find services</a>. We will strive to execute these terms only in pursuit of that mission, and no further.
	<br /><br />
	Feel free to <a ui-sref="contact-us">contact us</a> about these terms. We commit to improve them as we grow.
